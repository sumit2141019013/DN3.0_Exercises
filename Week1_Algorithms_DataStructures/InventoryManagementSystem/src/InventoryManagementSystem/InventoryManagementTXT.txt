1. Understanding the Problem:
Q1: Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories
Ans: Efficient Storage: Proper data structures shall ensure efficient storage of large amounts of data; this will reduce not only memory usage but also the access time.
Quick Retrieval: Algorithms will enable fast retrieval and updating of inventory data to ensure smooth warehouse operations.
Scalability: Scalable data structures combined with efficient algorithms will ensure that as the inventory grows, the system's performance does not degrade.
Data Integrity: Proper data structures and algorithms ensure consistency of data and no corruption in case of concurrent operations.
Q2: Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
Ans: ArrayList: Maintaining a list of products with easy index-based access; poor for searching by productId.
HashMap: Greatly efficient in look-up, insertion, and deletion based on unique product IDs.
LinkedList: This will turn out to be useful in cases of frequent addition and deletion. Since it provides efficient insertion and deletion, the lookup times are slower.
2. Analysis:
Time Complexity:
Add Operation: The average time complexity for adding a product using HashMap is O(1).
Update Operation: The average time complexity for updating a product using HashMap is O(1).
Delete Operation: The average time complexity for deleting a product using HashMap is O(1).
Optimizing Operations:
Load Factor and Resizing: Ensure the load factor of the HashMap is optimized (default is 0.75). This helps in maintaining O(1) time complexity by minimizing collisions.
Concurrency: For a multi-threaded environment, consider using ConcurrentHashMap which allows concurrent access and modifications without compromising performance.
Batch Operations: Implement bulk operations for adding, updating, or deleting multiple products at once to reduce overhead and improve performance.
