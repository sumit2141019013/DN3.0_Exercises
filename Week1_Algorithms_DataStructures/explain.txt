Exercise 1: Inventory Management System
1. Understand the Problem:
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Efficient handling of large inventories requires fast and reliable data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
Proper data structures and algorithms ensure that operations like adding, updating, and deleting inventory items are performed quickly and efficiently.
Suitable Data Structures:

ArrayList: Allows dynamic resizing and provides fast access to elements.
HashMap: Offers efficient key-value pair storage, allowing quick lookups, insertions, and deletions.
Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function
1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Big O Notation:

A mathematical notation that describes the upper limit of an algorithm's runtime as the input size grows.
Helps in analyzing and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms.
Search Operation Scenarios:

Best Case: The scenario where the search completes in the least amount of time.
Average Case: The expected runtime for typical inputs.
Worst Case: The maximum time the algorithm could take to complete.
Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders
1. Understand Sorting Algorithms:
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new item into its correct position.
Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into smaller arrays and recursively sorts them.
Merge Sort: Also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
Exercise 4: Employee Management System
1. Understand Array Representation:
Array Representation:

Arrays are stored contiguously in memory, allowing constant-time access to elements via indices.
They are simple to implement and efficient for fixed-size collections of data.
Exercise 5: Task Management System
1. Understand Linked Lists:
Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List: Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Doubly Linked List: Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Exercise 6: Library Management System
1. Understand Search Algorithms:
Search Algorithms:

Linear Search: Sequentially checks each element of the list until the target element is found or the list ends.
Binary Search: Efficiently searches a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found.
Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
1. Understand Recursive Algorithms:
Recursion:

A method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
Simplifies solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
